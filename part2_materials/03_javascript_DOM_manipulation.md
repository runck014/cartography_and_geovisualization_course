# Working with the DOM in Javascript

There are several ways you can select elements in the DOM:

1. Drill down from the `document` object using `document.body.children` for DOM traversal
2. Using `document.getElementById` to select elements by their ID attribute
3. Using `document.getElementsByClassName` to select elements by their class name
4. Using `document.querySelector` or `document.querySelectorAll` to select elements using CSS selectors
5. Using `document.getElementsByTagName` to select elements by their tag name
