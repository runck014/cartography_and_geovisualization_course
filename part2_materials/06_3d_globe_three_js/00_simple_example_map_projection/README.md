# Three.js Globe Example with Map Projection

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run a local server: `npx vite` or any other local server
3. Open in browser: http://localhost:5173 (or the URL provided by your server)

## Description
This example demonstrates how to create a 3D globe with map projection using Three.js and D3. It shows how to:

- Convert latitude/longitude coordinates to 3D positions
- Create a wireframe globe with graticule lines
- Add interactive city markers with labels
- Display coordinate information on hover
- Implement a detailed information panel with camera, controls, and performance metrics
