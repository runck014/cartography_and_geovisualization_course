# Three.js Globe Example with Coordinates

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run a local server: `npx vite` or any other local server
3. Open in browser: http://localhost:5173 (or the URL provided by your server)

## Description
This example demonstrates a 3D globe with coordinate systems in Three.js. It builds on the basic globe example by adding a graticule grid, coordinate axes (X, Y, Z), and a detailed stats panel that displays scene parameters in real-time.
