# Guidelines for Project Proposal

Your project proposal will serve as a concise yet detailed roadmap for developing a your geovisualization. 
It should clearly articulate the purpose, design choices, technical approach, and anticipated challenges. 
The final document should be no more than two pages, including sketches and tables where necessary.

## Proposal Structure
### Introduction (1-2 sentences each)
- Title of GeoVisualization
- Intended audience
- Communication goal
- How does this relate to your inspiration (include a Figure 1 screenshot of the inspriation)?

### Design Sketches / Wireframe
- Create a sketch of what your geovisualization will look like. Show the interfaces it will have.
- Annotate what users will be able to do with it.
- Hand drawn or digital mockups in PowerPoint, Inkscape, etc are fine

### Data (Create a Table)
- What datasets will you use?
- Where will you find them?
- What data wrangling will you have to do to make the data useable?
- What visual variable in your design sketch will you use to represent the data?

### Exploratory Analysis
- Make a quick and dirty figure or map from your data illustrating where you might go.

### Technology Stack
- What technology stack will you use? Go into some detail.

### Risks and Challenges
- What are the risks facing your project or what challenges do you think you'll face?
- How will you mitigate these risks?
- What aspects of the project might be particularly difficult?

### Timeline
- What are the milestones you'll hit as you move toward the end product?

## General Comments
- Be brief and concise. We will use this document for discussion.
- Use pictures instead of words.
- Use tables instead of paragraphs.
