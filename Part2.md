# Advanced Geovisualization

## Course Description

The generation and use of geographic information has become an integral part of our daily life, science, and technology. This has led to increasing interest in the design and development of interactive maps and dynamic geographic visualizations in 2D, 3D, and Web environments. The Advanced Geovisualization course intends to equip students with the knowledge and advanced technical skills needed to design and implement effective maps and create dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Use advanced visualization tools and techniques to create interactive visualizations in 2D and 3D
- Build geovisualization systems that rely on big spatial data
- Describe the value and use of geovisualization techniques for scientific exploration and understanding
- Describe and design around the limits of human cognition and computational performance

# Week 2
- Reading:
  - [Franconeri et al. 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdlqZH34GBYvx1FX4uYLZkR0wY0jXx6C/view?usp=drive_link)
  - [Dimara et al. 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mIHa3YSOAqK6zRczvMbXAfKiqfWqbVBn/view?usp=drive_link)
- Assignment 1: Discussion prework. ```Do a deep reading of Franconeri et al 2021 and Dimara et al 2022. Write a 4-6 page essay (no more than 1000 words) with your own visuals/sketches that 1) summarizes what we know about the science of data visualization. Draw from other visualization texts where appropriate. 2) For each thing we know, find your own example of someone breaking from best practice on the internet, screenshot it, and include it as a figure. Other items: Cite your sources. Do not use ChatGPT or other LLMs. Expect to spend ~6 hours minimum on this assignment. Produce a visually appealing final product with good layout and design.```
