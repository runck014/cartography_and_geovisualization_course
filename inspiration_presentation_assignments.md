# Inspiration Presentations

For this assignment, you will create and deliver a 15-minute presentation that explores inspiring examples of geovisualization and conducts a deep dive into one from a design and technology perspective.

## Presentation Structure

### 1.	Introduction (2-3 min)
- Introduce unifying theme or concepts
- Outline the examples you will go through


### 2. Showcase of Inspiring Geovisualizations (5-7 min)
- Present 3-5 compelling examples of geovisualizations. These could be from scientific journals, government agencies, private industry, or open-source projects. Look for examples that rely on [D3](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) and the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/).
- Discuss what makes these visualizations effective or innovative in terms of data representation, user interaction, aesthetics, and decision support. Discuss in terms of visual variables.
- Highlight any common design principles, techniques, or software used.


### 3. Deep Dive into One Example (5-7 min)
- Choose one geovisualization to analyze in depth.
- Break it down into:
  - Design Choices: How are color, scale, symbology, and layout used to communicate spatial relationships?
  - Technology Stack: What tools, frameworks, and data sources power the visualization?
  - Interactivity & Usability: How does the design facilitate interpretation and decision-making?
  - Limitations & Improvements: What are the potential drawbacks, and how could it be improved?


### 4. Discussion & Next Steps (2-3 min)
- Conclude by connecting your insights to your own geovisualization project proposal.
- Pose 1-2 open questions for class discussion about design trade-offs, future trends, or areas for innovation in 2D geovisualization.


### Submission & Format:
- Slide Deck (10-15 slides) with a clear narrative and visuals.
- Presentation (15 min total) with engaging delivery and thoughtful analysis.
- Cite sources and tools used.
